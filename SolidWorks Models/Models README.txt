This folder contains the Solidworks assembly and part files that formed the basis of our design.
File formats are .SLDPRT for parts, and .SLDASM for assemblies.
Files can only be opened on a device with SolidWorks installed.
Some assemblies and parts are dependent on others, so it is recommended that all files from the folder are downloaded and contained in the search path.
